# harness-cli
Harness CLI for managing Harness entities, from the command line with YAML as input. Current focus is on the entities needed for the CD & GitOps module. Other modules will be covered in the future.

- Uses public [Harness REST APIs](https://apidocs.harness.io/)
- Requires a [Harness API Key](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/user-management/add-and-manage-api-keys/) for authenticating with your Harness account.
